# Meloco: Language learning app

The app is currently under development

The application is take some idea from the [Hiragana Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myapps.hiragana) and [Katakana Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myapps.katakana) applications. But I also add my own taste to it.
